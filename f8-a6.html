      I believe that the third clue has been withdrawn. You may be wondering why the second clue was Clue 03. This is because I deemed Clue 02 excessive. I may release the passkey for Clue 2 at the end of the hunt.

        It seems I have forgotten to include one message on Clue 01. I forgot to emphasize that it is <b>critical</b> that all hunters work together during the beginning of the hunt. Please share information about clues you find, and work with others to find solutions to riddles.

    To use the decyption tool, enter the passkey from the clue you received and the clue number which you received. This not only grants you access to an online copy of clues, but also repels impostors.
